# Product: Sequential Thinking MCP Server

## 1. Core Purpose

This project is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) server that facilitates a structured, sequential thinking process. Its primary function is to help a user or an AI agent break down complex problems into manageable, step-by-step "thoughts."

## 2. Problem Solved

The server addresses the challenge of unstructured problem-solving. When faced with a complex task, it's easy to lose track of the process, miss steps, or use tools inefficiently. This server provides a framework to:

*   **Enforce a Methodical Approach:** It guides the user through a logical sequence of thoughts.
*   **Maintain Context:** It keeps a history of the thought process, including branches and revisions, preventing context loss.
*   **Guide Tool Usage:** It intelligently recommends the most appropriate tools for each specific step of the problem, improving efficiency and effectiveness.

## 3. High-Level Functionality

The server exposes a single, powerful MCP tool named `sequentialthinking_tools`. Its key capabilities include:

*   **Thought Processing:** Receives a "thought" and integrates it into the ongoing problem-solving sequence.
*   **State Management:** Tracks the current thought number, the total estimated thoughts, and whether more steps are needed.
*   **Advanced Reasoning:** Supports non-linear thinking through branching (exploring alternative paths) and revision (updating previous thoughts with new insights).
*   **Intelligent Tool Recommendation:** For each thought, it can analyze the situation and recommend a prioritized list of other available MCP tools. Each recommendation includes a confidence score, a rationale for its use, and suggested inputs.
