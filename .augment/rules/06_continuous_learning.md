<overview>Ensure the team and the Augment‑Code agent stay current with Python releases and best practices.</overview>
<rules>
  - `Release cadence`: Review Python 3.13 release notes each beta; file issues for deprecations.
  - `Weekly learning PR`: Rotate ownership; each week someone contributes a PR showcasing a new language/library feature with tests and docs.
  - `Agent feedback loop`: After each AI-generated patch, add a comment with “✅”, “🤔”, or “❌” to train preference model.
  - `Internal tech talks`: Present learnings monthly; record and store in knowledge base.
  - `RFC process`: Propose significant changes via docs/rfc/NNNN-description.md; require team consensus.
