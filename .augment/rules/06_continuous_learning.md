Purpose
Ensure the team and the Augment‑Code agent stay current with Python releases and best practices.

Rules
	1.	Release cadence – Review Python 3.13 release notes each beta; file issues for deprecations.
	2.	Weekly learning PR – Rotate ownership; each week someone contributes a PR showcasing a new language/library feature with tests and docs.
	3.	Agent feedback loop – After each AI‑generated patch, add a comment with “✅”, “🤔”, or “❌” to train preference model.
	4.	Internal tech talks – Present learnings monthly; record and store in knowledge base.
	5.	RFC process – Propose significant changes via docs/rfc/NNNN-description.md; require team consensus.
